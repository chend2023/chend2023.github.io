I am a PhD candidate with a strong interest in network science and machine learning, and my research interests involve renormalization and robustness of complex networks, social networks, information science, and graph neural networks.

I received my M.S. degree in Circuits and Systems from [Hubei University](https://www.hubu.edu.cn/), Wuhan, China, in 2019. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD degree in artificial intelligence from the School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), Wuhan, China.
